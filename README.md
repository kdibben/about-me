## About
This repository contains useful tools and resources for GitHub Pages and Web Development as well as a little bit of information about myself. 

## Recommended Tools
It is very easy to publish a repository using GitHub Pages. All you need is:
- A github account
- A web browser
- A little bit of knowledge writing in markdown

You can create a github account by going [here](https://github.com/join).

You can use any browser of your choosing, but I recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). 

Markdown is a markup language that formats text into web pages. It is easy to learn and write in and you will be ready to create web pages in no time. To learn markdown I would recommend the following guides:
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [How to Write Faster, Better & Longer: The Ultimate Guide to Markdown](https://ghost.org/blog/markdown/)

## Recommended Resources
For web development, I think it is important to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are a few resources that I recommend for learning these programming languages:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools is an online resource that contain many tutorials and examples to help you learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Codecademy offers courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other programming languages. A lot of the courses are free and they also have a pro upgrade for more content and a path option. 
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/web-development/) - Udemy is a platform that offer tons of courses in many different things. There are many courses for web development on there. The courses do cost money but they always have huge sales going on. I am working through an iOS developent course on there right now and I am really enjoying it. 
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - freeCodeCamp is another free resource to learn web development. 
- [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) - Pluralsight is an online platform with courses in all areas of Computer Science. It also has learning paths and a skill IQ feature. I used it during my internship this summer to learn Xamarin.Forms and there is a lot of great courses on there. It is quite expensive but there is a lot of useful content if you are able to pay for it.
