## About
This repository contains useful tools and resources for GitHub Pages and Web Development as well as a little bit of information about myself. 

## Recommended Tools
It is very easy to publish a repository using GitHub Pages. All you need is:
- A github account
- A web browser
- A little bit of knowledge writing code in markdown

You can create a github account by going [here](https://github.com/join).

You can use any browser of your choosing but I recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). 

Markdown is a markup language that formats text into web pages. It is easy to learn and write in and will have you ready to create web pages in no time. To learn markdown I would recommend the following guides:
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [How to Write Faster, Better & Longer: The Ultimate Guide to Markdown](https://ghost.org/blog/markdown/)
