                    I am a senior working on a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Mobile
                    Computing. I
                    will be graduating in the spring.

                    Background
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am from Blair, Nebraska. I attended Blair High School and graduated in 2016. I did not have much
                    experience in
                    the area of Computer Science prior to attending Northwest. I took a programming class in high school
                    but
                    that
                    was pretty much it. I've always loved technology and decided to pursue a degree in it. I almost went
                    here
                    for
                    Accounting instead because I took a couple accounting courses in high school and really enjoyed
                    them,
                    but
                    ultimately decided I wanted to major in Computer Science. This summer I had an internship at Streck
                    as a
                    Programming Intern. Streck is a biotech company located in La Vista, Nebraska. During my time there,
                    I
                    developed
                    a proof-of-concept mobile application using Xamarin.Forms. Outside of school I enjoy music,
                    photography,
                    and
                    art.

                    Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from Northwest, I would love to work as a mobile developer. I am getting my
                    emphasis in
                    Mobile
                    Computing and it is an area that I find very interesting. I've always loved mobile technology,
                    especially
                    Apple's technology. I am always interested in the latest and greatest products. I think it would be
                    really
                    cool
                    to develop for those products and work in an area that interests me so much. Something interesting about me is that I love music and can play quite a few instruments.
