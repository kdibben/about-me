I am a senior working on a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Mobile Computing. I will be graduating in the spring. 

I am from Blair, Nebraska. I attended Blair High School and graduated in 2016. I did not have much experience in the area of Computer Science prior to attending Northwest. I took a programming class in high school but that was pretty much it. I've always loved technology and decided to pursue a degree in it. I almost went here for Accounting instead because I took a couple accounting courses in high school and really enjoyed them, but ultimately decided I wanted to major in Computer Science. This summer I had an internship at Streck as a Programming Intern. Streck is a biotech company located in La Vista, Nebraska. During my time there, I developed a proof-of-concept mobile application using Xamarin.Forms. Outside of school I enjoy music, photography, and art. 

After graduating from Northwest, I would love to work as a mobile developer. I am getting my emphasis in Mobile Computing and it is an area that I find very interesting. I've always loved mobile technology, especially Apple's technology. I am always interested in the latest and greatest products. I think it would be really cool to develop for those products and work in an area that interests me so much. 

Something interesting about me is that I love music and can play quite a few instruments. My LinkedIn profile can be found at www.linkedin.com/in/kelsie-dibben
